<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although the origin of this beloved cookie is up for debate, there's no doubt it's a favorite during the holidays. Snickerdoodles are a type of drop cookie (any cookie that is formed by dropping spoonfuls of dough directly onto a baking sheet) that is coated in cinnamon and sugar. They can be crisp or soft, with a slightly cracked surface.</p>
<p>This is my great-grandma's recipe that everyone loves!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>

    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.</li>
    <li>Beat 1 1/2 cups white sugar, butter, and eggs together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough holds together.</li>
